REACT_APP_OPENWEATHERMAP_DOMAIN=http://openweathermap.org
REACT_APP_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_DOMAIN=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5
REACT_APP_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=

In the project directory, you can run:
To install 
### `npm install`

To run
### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To build

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
